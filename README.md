# Lorenz-System-Simulation
A very simple simulation of the Lorenz Attractor that I made for fun.

(I'll probably clean the code and combine the files into a concise program later)

Note: This may be somewhat innacurate because I used Euler's Method for numerical integration. I'll try to fix that later.
